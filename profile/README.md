# PAYDAY 2 Aim Assist

When the alarm screams, subtlety dies—and rhythm takes over. In **PAYDAY 2**, loud heists are storms of shields, cloakers, and endless waves pressing from every angle. In that chaos, accuracy isn’t about twitch reflexes alone. It’s about control.

The **PAYDAY 2 Aim Assist** is a precision-focused PC module built to steady your hand without stealing the moment. Not a harsh snap. Not a robotic lock. Just enough guidance to let intent flow cleanly from thought to trigger.
